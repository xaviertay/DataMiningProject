# DataMiningProject
WQD7005 Data Mining Final Milestone

The project pipeline starts with data extraction --> data preprocessing ---> correlation analysis ---> descriptive analysis --> sentiment analysis --> predictive analysis

Data extraction, data preprocessing, correlation analysis, some part of descriptive analysis and sentiment analysis are done by using Python

Some part of descriptive analysis and predictive analysis are done using SAS Enterprise Miner

Things to take note:

Before importing the library of some classes in python, there are few installation packages have to be included in your machine such as nltk and xgboost library.

For unstructured data, severity of weather news collected is self-labelled.

Workspaces folder in SAS Enterprise Miner is empty because there are more than 100 files and thus can't upload to github by drag and drop.
